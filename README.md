# HandoverOptimDRL
Framework for learning handover algorithms using deep reinforcement learning. This repo provides the codebase and results for [1].

## Usage
- The Vienna 5G Simulator routes can be found in the folder `routes` as .csv files. 
- The database used for the simulation is pre-stored in `data_from_vienna`. Use `karlsruheScenario.m` in the Vienna 5G Simulator to configure your scenario.
- Take these files to start the Python script `main.py`. Please don't forget to create an output folder and adjust the file paths.
