# HandoverOptimDRL
Framework for learning handover algorithms using deep reinforcement learning.

*CODE IS CURRENTLY BEING REVISED. A NEW VERSION WILL BE AVAILABLE SOON.*

## Description
HandoverOptimDRL is a framework designed to facilitate the development and evaluation of handover algorithms using deep reinforcement learning, i.e., proximal policy optimization (PPO).
It provides tools and environments to simulate the 3GPP handover protocol and to train and evaluate a PPO-based handover protocol.

This repository contains the source code, data sets and trained PPO model for the paper *A Deep Reinforcement Learning-based Approach for Adaptive Handover Protocols* [1].

## Installation
To install the HandoverOptimDRL package, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kit-cel/HandoverOptimDRL
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd HandoverOptimDRL
    ```

3. Set up the environment:
    ```bash
    python setup.py install
    ```

You are now ready to use the HandoverOptimDRL framework for your projects.
